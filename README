Define the Helper marker for the system:
    Here is the scenario of how the user should interact with the application:
    • User types: @Helper
    • System responds: @Helper-
    • User adds marker name and period: @Helper-email.
    • System searches for settings for email markers in the database. If not found, it prompts:
    "Do you want to create a new marker with the name 'email' (y/n)?"
  If the user types 'y', the system responds:
    @Helper-email.
    --Template
        Please write here the template content. After finishing, go to the new line and type ‘— Wizard.’
  • After the user completes the template, type –Wizard on the new line. For example, something like this:

    @Helper-email.
    --Template
        Hello, {{name}}! This is an automated message from our system.
        We are writing to inform you that your {{account}} is due for payment. Please log in to your account at {{url}} to make a payment.
        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
    --Wizard


  • System will return the list of placeholders with the questions marks on the end:
    @Helper-email.
    --Template
    Hello, {{name}}! This is an automated message from our system.
    We are writing to inform you that your {{account}} is due for payment. Please log in to your account at {{url}} to make a payment.
    Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
    --Wizard
    name?
    account?
    url?


  • After the user completes the template by adding the questions, he adds @End at the end to indicate he wants to save the marker 'email' to the database.
        Something like this, for example:
    @Helper-email.
    --Template
        Hello, {{name}}! This is an automated message from our system.
        We are writing to inform you that your {{account}} is due for payment. Please log in to your account at {{url}} to make a payment.
        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. --Wizard
        What is your name?
        hat type of account do you have (-Checking-, Savings, Credit Card, Other)?
        What is the URL for your account login page?
        @End


 Now the procedure for using the token.

   When the token is ready and written to the database. You can write:
    ///email.
    Where email is the name of the token.
    The system will immediately show the first question.
    ///email.
    ///What is your name?
    The user must enter a value after the question mark and put the /// sign after it, meaning the input is complete.
    ///What is your name?John///
    The system will ask the following question in the list
    ///email.
    ///What is your name?John///
    ///What type of account do you have (-Checking-, Savings, Credit Card, Other)?checking///
    ///What is the URL for your account login page?login.io///

After the last questions is answered, the system will append "///End" to the next line

    ///email.
    ///What is your name?John///
    ///What type of account do you have (-Checking-, Savings, Credit Card, Other)?checking///
    ///What is the URL for your account login page?login.io///
    ///End

 The system then clear the questions and display the filled template like below:

    Hello, John! This is an automated message from our system.
    We are writing to inform you that your Checking is due for payment.
    Please log in to your account at login.io to make a payment.
